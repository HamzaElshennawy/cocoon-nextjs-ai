# Cocoon NextJS Application

## Firebase Network Error Fixes

This application includes comprehensive fixes for Firebase authentication network errors (`auth/network-request-failed`). The following improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific error handling for `auth/network-request-failed` errors
- Implemented timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging requests
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures

### 2. Network Connectivity Monitoring
- Real-time network status detection using browser APIs
- Visual indicators for offline/online status
- Automatic retry mechanisms when network connectivity is restored

### 3. Diagnostic Tools
- Built-in connection testing for both general internet and Firebase connectivity
- Network latency measurement
- Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Clear error messages for network-related issues
- Automatic retry with user feedback
- Connection status indicators in the UI

### Common Network Error Solutions

If you're still experiencing network errors:

1. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. **Firewall/Proxy Issues**: Check if your network blocks Firebase services
3. **DNS Issues**: Try using a different DNS server (8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1)
4. **Browser Extensions**: Disable VPN or proxy browser extensions temporarily
5. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies

### Testing Network Connectivity

Use the "ðŸ”§ Test Connection" button on the login page to diagnose connectivity issues. This will test both general internet connectivity and Firebase service accessibility.
